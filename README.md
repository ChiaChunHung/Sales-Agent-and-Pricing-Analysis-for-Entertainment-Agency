# Sales-Agent-and-Pricing-Analysis-for-Entertainment-Agency
> Data-Driven Insights for Entertainment Agency Growth

## Project Overview

TuneWorks is a mid-sized entertainment agency managing entertainers, clients, and bookings. Despite having a robust data engineering infrastructure, they lack an in-house analytics function. This project, conducted by **McBrainsey & Co.**, delivers comprehensive SQL-based analysis and AI-assisted exploration to unlock the value of their operational data.

### Business Challenge

- **Untapped Data Value**: Large volumes of operational data exist but aren't leveraged for strategic decision-making
- **No Analytics Function**: Lack of in-house capability for sophisticated data analysis
- **Limited Insights**: Unable to identify patterns across entertainers, agents, customers, and engagements
- **Reactive Management**: Decisions based on intuition rather than data-driven evidence

### Project Mission

Transform TuneWorks' raw data into actionable business intelligence through:
- Comprehensive data exploration and quality assessment
- Discovery of patterns and relationships across key business entities
- Quantification of key performance indicators
- Development of strategic recommendations for talent management, pricing optimization, and client segmentation
- Comparison of independent SQL analysis with AI-assisted insights

## Objectives

1. **Data Familiarization**: Thoroughly understand dataset structure, relationships, and business meaning
2. **Data Quality Assessment**: Identify and address data quality issues (missing values, duplicates, inconsistencies)
3. **Exploratory Analysis**: Discover patterns and trends across business entities
4. **Business Metrics**: Quantify KPIs (revenue, booking frequency, engagement duration, entertainer popularity)
5. **Strategic Recommendations**: Develop actionable strategies for business growth
6. **AI Collaboration**: Compare manual SQL analysis with AI-assisted insights

## Dataset Overview

The TuneWorks dataset consists of **12 interconnected tables**:

### Core Business Tables
- **Agents**: Agency representatives (11 fields including salary, commission rate)
- **Customers**: Client information and contact details (8 fields)
- **Engagements**: Booking contracts linking customers, agents, and entertainers (9 fields)
- **Entertainers**: Performer information and contact details (10 fields)

### Supporting Tables
- **Entertainer_Members**: Maps entertainers to individual members (bands/groups)
- **Entertainer_Styles**: Musical style proficiency for each entertainer
- **Members**: Individual performer details
- **Musical_Preferences**: Customer music style preferences
- **Musical_Styles**: Master list of music genres
- **Time Dimension Tables**: ztblDays, ztblMonths (for temporal analysis)
